At University I was the one sitting in the front row and taking notes, and sharing them with my classmates after. Taking notes, knowing it will be read by others, made me do it better â€“ so it helped me as well.<br> This page was born because I wanted to share knowledge. The life is complicated enough so, my goal here is to make the material more welcoming for people that feel like I did. <br>Lastly, because we are in the â€˜about meâ€™ page, I will take the opportunity to thank you for visiting here ðŸ™‚ Enjoy! Want to chat? Iâ€™d love to! You can find me on LinkedIn"
